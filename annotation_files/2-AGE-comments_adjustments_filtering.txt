The following comments refer to the 2-AGE-sample_annotation2.csv file, which is intended for further analysis.
To obtain consistency or. an equal amount of timestamps for the samples only the timestamps 3,12,24,48,60 were selected (which excludes all samples from child nr. 2 since some of those timestamps are missing). 
All samples can still be found in the 2-AGE-sample_annotation.csv file.
