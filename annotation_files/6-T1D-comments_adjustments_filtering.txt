The following comments refer to the 6-T1D-sample_annotation_case.csv file, which is intended for further analysis.
Only the case samples were kept and only those of where the methylation screening tool is the EPIC BeadChip.
To obtain consistency or. an equal amount of timestamps for the samples only 3 timestamps were chosen (the fourth was deleted if present). The Timestamps 3,4,5 were chosen because they were the most frequent of the four (2,3,4,5) timestamps. 
All samples in their original condition can be found in the 6-T1D-sample_annotation.csv file.
