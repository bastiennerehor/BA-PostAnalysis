# BA-PostAnalysis
All script used for the post analysis for my Bachelor Thesis ('Implementing Time-Series Analysis for Differentially Methylated Regions in DiMmer'). The post analysis is solely done in R. It treats DMR count and overlaps analysis, genomic regions enrichment, CpG clustering and DMR alpha &amp; beta diversity score calculation.
Additionally, the annotation files created for the selected datasets in the BA are included with a description of all adjustments and filtering of the samples if any.
